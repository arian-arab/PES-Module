# PES-Module
Software for processing photoelectron spectroscopy experiment data. This softwatr is capable to process one, two and three dimensional PES datasets.

As an example of 1-dimensional data analysis, the Gold 4f peaks are shown, where the software allows fitting the peaks using two Voigt functions.
